# DogeCam - Setting up Video Playback asset
To be able to use the feature, the end-user must first configure the asset/file they want to play. The file must be in mp4 format.
The process will involve copying the file to the extension's directory as per the browser.

**NOTE**: FireFox is currently ***NOT*** supported for this feature!

***DISCLAIMER***
*The feature should be used responsibly. The User should use this feature at their own discretion.*

# Chrome File setup
Preferably, ***only enable the mode after configuring the playback asset/file***. Try and limit the file size/duration, the playback is going to be looped anyway.

1. In the browser, navigate to: chrome://version/
2. Copy the Profile Path value and open the folder in Explorer/Finder/Navigator. 
3. From the folder open Extensions folder.
4. Here, the folder to open will depend on the Extension's identifier/ID. Check DogeCam's ID as on Chrome's extensions page: chrome://extensions/
5. Open the folder-> And it's version subfolder. Now you are at the extension's root. Simply navigate to videos folder and replace sample.mp4 with a version of your choice.

***NOTE***: The filename **should** remain ***sample.mp4***

# DogeCam - Setting up Video Playback asset
To be able to use the feature, the end-user must first configure the asset/file they want to play. The file must be in mp4 format.
The process will involve copying the file to the extension's directory as per the browser.

**NOTE**: FireFox is currently ***NOT*** supported!

# Chrome File setup

* **Windows**:
  1. From Start Menu, start the "Run" program.
  2. Open "%localappdata%".
  3. In the file explorer, Navigate to Google-> Chrome-> User Data-> Default-> Extensions.
  4. Here, the folder to open will depend on the Extension's identifier/ID. Check DogeCam's ID as on Chrome's extensions page.(chrome://extensions/).
  5. Open the folder-> And it's subfolder. Now you are the extension's root. Simply navigate to videos folder and replace sample.mp4 with a version of your choice.
